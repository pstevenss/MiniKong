# MiniKong
MiniKong is a greenfoot Java-based game that draws inspiration from the classic retro game Donkey Kong. The game features challenging levels that requires the player to climb ladders, collect gems, and play mini-games to reach the end goal.

One unique feature of MiniKong is the incorporation of mini-games in between platforms. These mini-games require players to use critical thinking skills to solve puzzles and challenges within a set time limit. Successfully completing these mini-games allows the player to collect a gem, signifying completion of the level.

* Advice given from Dr. Rasamny, noted by Devyon:
    * More puzzle than question with an answer
    * Game can be already existing and altered to fit our problem statement
